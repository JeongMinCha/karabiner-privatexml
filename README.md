# private.xml in Karabiner

I have been using [Karabiner](https://github.com/JeongMinCha/karabiner-privatexml).
This application is priceless for Mac OS X User who want to map keys in keyboard.

Your private XML file is located at
```
/Users/$(whoami)/Library/Application\ Support/Karabiner/private.xml
```
$(whoami) means your user name.
